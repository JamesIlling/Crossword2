# Crossword Maker

## Requirements

1. Get Last 30 days of (cryptic) crosswords from the Guardian
2. I want them all merged into a single PDF file called `crosswords.pdf`
3. There is no need to add any tests at this point

## Notes

* Cryptic Crosswords are available in PDF from the Guardian at the address like `https://crosswords-static.guim.co.uk/gdn.cryptic.20241104.pdf`
* The Date and Time components for Python and C# support adding or removing days which takes into account months and leap years.
* The cryptic crosswords are not published every day `A cryptic crossword is published every weekday in the Guardian`
